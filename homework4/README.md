- create a project with an MVC model similarly to the one we learned in class,

- have a log-in button that shows a modal pop-up when clicked with an ADDITIONAL modal/alert that lets users know they've logged in once the "submit" or "log-in" button is clicked,
- create the modals with jQuery and style them with CSS/SCSS,
- use npm to package the project,
- upload the project to the Web4 server,
