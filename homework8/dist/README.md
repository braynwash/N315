# Homework Eight

This is the eight homework assignment for N315, and is an (almost) CRUD application where users can add, view, and delete recipes.

# Purpose

The JungleCook project serves as a basic CRUD application using JQuery and Sass that teaches developers the ins and outs (and best practices) of reading user inputs, displaying them, and deleting them if indicated by the user. The Junglecook project also teaches basic email/password user authentication through Firebase.

# Tasks

In this project, I have...

- created a responsive web page that looks identical to the provided prototype across all media sizes,
- included user feedback modals for when a recipe is created and when a user is logged/signed in,
- included functions for gathering user input, displaying user input, and deleting user input (**COULD NOT GET AROUND TO ALLOWING USERS TO EDIT**).
- set up Firebase's authentication to allow a user to create an account using an email and password,
- uploaded the project to the Web4 server,
- uploaded the project to Github, and
- submited the project with the link to the Github repo.
