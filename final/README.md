# Final Project

This is my final project for 315 Adv. Web Development at IUPUI.

# Purpose

This project is a recreation of the Keurig (product and cart pages) website that serves as a basic e-commerce site using JQuery, Sass, and basic email/password user authentication through Google Firebase.

# Tasks

In this project, I have...

- created a responsive web page that looks identical to the provided prototype,
- included user feedback modals for when a user adds/removes products from their cart AND when users log in, log out, or create a new account,
- loaded available products in a json file that then load dynamically onto the page,
- added a cart that showcases number of items in cart in a navigation icon and loads selected products onto the cart page,
- set up Firebase's authentication to allow a user to create an account using an email and password,
- uploaded the project to the Web4 server,
- uploaded the project to Github, and
- submited the project with the link to the Github repo.
